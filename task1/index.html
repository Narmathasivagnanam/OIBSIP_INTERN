				<u>About:-</u>
			</h1>
			<p>
				☛ Master of Alternating Current (AC):  
                Tesla is best known for developing the alternating current (AC) electrical system, which became the global standard for power transmission due to its efficiency over long distances.  <br><br>
				☛ Inventor of the Tesla Coil:  
                In 1891, Tesla invented the Tesla Coil, a device that produced high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating current electricity. It remains widely used today in radio technology and wireless transmission. <br><br>
				☛ Pioneer of Wireless Communication: 
                Tesla's experiments in wireless communication predated many of the technologies we use today. He envisioned a world where information could be transmitted without wires—ideas that laid the groundwork for modern Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and radio.
				<br><br>
				☛Father of Robotics:  
                Tesla’s work in automation led him to develop the basic principles of robotics. He was one of the first to conceive of machines that could be programmed to carry out tasks autonomously.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Contributions to X-ray Technology: 
                Tesla conducted early experiments in X-ray imaging, contributing valuable insights to the development of this revolutionary technology, which would become vital in the medical field.  <br><br>
                ☛ Visionary Behind Renewable Energy:  
                Tesla was an advocate of renewable energy and believed in harnessing the natural forces of the Earth, particularly from wind and solar power. His ideas about sustainability were ahead of his Time.  <br><br>
                ☛ A Legacy of Innovation and Inspiration:  
                Though many of Tesla's ambitious projects remained unfinished or underfunded, his visions continue to inspire scientists, engineers, and innovators worldwide. He remains a symbol of boundless creativity and scientific ambition.
